## Updated Portfolio

üíÅ Need help updating your Portfolio? Check out the [career services milestone resources for online presence](https://mycareerspot.org/onlinepresence).

Your updated portfolio should:

1. Display your contact information. If you don't want to share your personal email or phone number, use a separate email that you will only use for coding, also known as a developer email, and/or a call forwarding service, such as [Google Voice](https://voice.google.com/).

2. Have links to your GitHub profile and LinkedIn profile

3. Have a link to a downloadable PDF of your resume

4. Display at least 2 examples of student work from either deployed projects or homeworks. For each project, make sure you have the following:

   - Project title

   - Link to the deployed version

   - Link to the GitHub repository

   - Screenshot of the deployed application

5. Have a polished, mobile-responsive user interface.

6. README files. Every pinned project should contain a README file with:

   - Title of app

   - Live link to deployed app

   - List of technologies used

   - 1-2 sentences explaining what the app is

   - 2-3 Screenshots / gifs of the app

   - License (usually MIT)

   - Contact information for you and any collaborators

7. Commit history. Every pinned repository should have at least 20 commits.
